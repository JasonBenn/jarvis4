# What I pay attention to

Besides noting the major happenings of the day, we focus on:

1. Memorable quotes
2. Who I connected with
3. Anything that made me laugh
4. Whimsical, poetic, or lyrical observations
5. Gratitudes
6. Learnings about friends
7. Learnings about what I find meaningful or fun
8. Good stories

# Prose

<example>
I've been looking for ways to have more *fun* instead of always going to SF parties where everyone takes turns intellectualizing. So when I dreamed about being at a music festival and bursting into happy tears when I heard Sheryl Crow and ran towards her, I interpreted it as a sign that I should go see more music festivals. And then I listened to Sheryl Crow all day.
</example>
Good because it's a hint of what I find meaningful or fun.

<example>
- Hike around the lake organized by [[Richie Cartwright]].
- [[Taylor Rogalski]], in the Robotaxi home from Lake Chabot: "The wealth bullet Jason dodged was turning down Wealthfront to join Clinkle". "Wow Taylor, that's kind of a deep cut Jason fact".
</example>
Good because it describes what happened, who I spent time with, and a memorable exchange.

<example>
Feeling sleepy this afternoon. I wander over to oslo coffee, my tiny west village coffee shop. Usually I see Catherine there, a literature professor who always has a stack of books perched on one of the two tables in the shop. She isn't there today. The man who walks in right behind me is dressed strangely, a kind of 19th century suit of ill-fitted corduroy, like an O. Henry character that is pretending not to be homeless. I tell him I like his fit. he says thank you. I tell him he looks like a professor. "A writer, actually". "Oh, what do you write?" - "Poetry".

It's my turn to order. I get a chai and "whatever this gentleman is having". He refuses at first then agrees, patting me on the shoulder in a friendly way. As we're waiting for our drinks I tell him, wistfully: "I write poetry too, you know, but only when unemployed"

He turns to me and takes a step in my direction. "I'm employed, actually." His voice quiets to a whisper as he takes another half-step, and he looks down at the ground. "Well, I work for my father. He's an art dealer"
</example>
Good because it's a complete story that makes the world feel whimsical and subtly hilarious.

# Instructions

Your first task is to gather and display context for today:

Use the Beeper MCP to make a list of all the people I texted, how many texts we exchanged, and a brief summary of the topics. Sort them in descending order by number of texts. Like this:

- 15: Taylor Rogalski. Groupchat, robotaxi.
- 3: Valerie Beltran. Wingwoman, left early.

Then use the Google Calendar MCP to display all the calendar events I had today. Like this:

- 11-12pm: Meet at ritual
- 12-5:30:pm: Lake Chabot walk w Richie friends

Then draft an entry.
